# Introduction
    The main purpose of this project is Getting public cloud monitor metric data (eg: ELB, EIP, NAT Gatway, connections, S3)
    to falcon. We can check the monitor metric data which can't get by monitor agent installed in the machine but avaiable on the cloud console at any time
    
# Prerequisite
* git  >= 1.7.5
* python2.X
* develop in ubuntu16, test in centos7.3


For getting KSC data, please read:
https://github.com/KscSDK/ksc-sdk-python

# Getting Started
```buildoutcfg
1. git clone git@github.com:open-falcon/cloud-mon.git
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. config your config.yml as following guide
4. run : 'python cloud2falcon.py'
5. You may encount user follow control when get lots of metric data, please connect to cloud provider solve it.
```

## Description：
- It will get all metric data per minute in 10 minutes by default, change it by yourself
- You can set linux cronjob for running it every 10 minutes
- step and period of time according to demand and cloud user flow control. The example is my best practices
- support: AWS, Alibaba cloud, kingsoft cloud
- config.yml
  
## example: 
     
        falcon_url: 'http://127.0.0.1:1988/v1/push'
        metric: 'cloud2falcon'
        step: 60
        period: 13
        cloud:
          - c_type: AWS
            resource: NATGateway
            name: 'NatGatewayId'
            to_falcon_template: 'aws-nat'
            ak: 'your ak'
            sk: 'your sk'
            region: [{"name": 'ap-southeast-1', "site": 'sgpaws'}]
            metric_list:  ['ActiveConnectionCount', 'PacketsDropCount']
